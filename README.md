If you're interested in the dataset for my paper: "Navigation Apps Induce Cut-through Traffic Congestion: an Analysis of Real-life App Routing Suggestions," please contact me at jerrylin3321@gmail.com. 

Note that all the Python code here is /very, very ugly/; I wrote it solely for the purpose of collecting data and conducting research, and I haven't had the time to clean it up. It's provided solely as a reference.
